# moviexml
creating displaying and formatting information about movies in XML XSLT HTML CSS

Step 1 - Creating a Movies XML file
  - containing information about your favorite movies.
  - should contain (1) movie ID, (2) title, (3) principal director, (4) year, and (5) multiple genre entries (such as action, comedy, drama,                     humor, animated).
  - In all but three of the movies, include one more field named uri that contains a hyperlink to the movie's description in some online database such as imdb.com
  - Include at last 15 movie entries. For genre types, refer to imdb.com
  
Step 2 - Displaying Movie Titles using XSLT
  - XSLT file that displays data from the movies.xml file
  - Display each movie title on a separate line, sorted in ascending order by title
  - Use the xsl:template, xsl:value-of, xsl:sort, and xsl:for-each statements

Step 3 - Formatting with Tables
  - Build on the previous version by adding attractive HTML formatting, using a table
  - Use CSS style classes to control the background color, padding, alignment, fonts, and other details
  - Display the id, title, director and year field as for each movie as columns in each table row
  - Place a heading row in the first line of the table
  
Step 4 - Using a movie Template
  - Modify the previous version by using a template for all output related to a single movie.
  - The resulting HTML output should be identical to the HTML produced by your previous version.
